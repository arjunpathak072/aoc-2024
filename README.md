# Advent of Code 2024 🎄

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges, implemented in **Go (Golang)**.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each day's solution is organized into its own folder named `day-x`, where `x` is the day of the challenge (e.g., `day-1`, `day-2`, ...). Each folder contains a `main.go` file with the implementation for that day's puzzle.

Example structure:
```
.
├── day-1
│   └── main.go
├── day-2
│   └── main.go
├── day-3
│   └── main.go
...
```

## 🚀 How to Run the Solutions

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your system. You can download it from [golang.org](https://golang.org/).
2. Navigate to the folder of the day you want to run:
   ```bash
   cd day-x
   ```
3. Run the solution:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

## 📝 Notes

- Each solution is designed to work with the input provided by the Advent of Code website.
- Make sure to place the input file (if required) in the appropriate folder and modify the code to read it if necessary.
- I name all my inputs as `day-x.input` where `x` is the day of the challenge.
- I have not included my own input sets in the repository as [recommended](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/e7khy8/comment/fa13hb9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) by one of the mods in the offcial subreddit.

Happy coding and good luck with Advent of Code 2024! 🎉
